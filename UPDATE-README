#This file includes instructions and notices for admins that they should keep in mind when updating mumble.
#WARNING: Backup your database regularly and before making any changes to it.

be925ea: Add mumble.bypassCore to your config file. True means mumble will fall back to the local database if the
    connection to Core fails.

    require for all passwords.
